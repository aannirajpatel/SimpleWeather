# SimpleWeather

A simple Android app written in Kotlin that consumes the OpenWeatherMap API using Retrofit and Moshi.

Given below are the step by step instructions on how to get started with making this app. Refer to this repo whenever you get stuck!

## Step 1

Create a new Android Studio project with an empty activity. Select API 19. Give a cool name to your app.

## Step 2

1. Add ViewBinding to your newly created project as shown [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)
2. Get Retrofit from [here](https://square.github.io/retrofit). This library is used to make network requests to, in this case, the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. Add Moshi from [here](https://github.com/square/moshi/). Make sure you get the Kotlin version, otherwise the app will compile but crash at runtime!
4. Add Kotlin coroutine support

## Step 3

Register on OpenWeatherMap's [website](https://https://openweathermap.org/) and generate an API key (it's free).

## Step 5

1. Open the Gradle Scripts section in the "Android" project files view mode, then open `local.properties`
2. Open

## Step 4

Start coding the app!
